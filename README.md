- Firebase uses websockets that make data transfer very fast!

- 10

  - check md5 library. It's normally used to hash messages. But we use it here, in Register.js to create a unique valuew to provide to gravatar url.

  Extra info:

  [Why would you hash a file?](https://www.2brightsparks.com/resources/articles/introduction-to-hashing-and-its-uses.html)
  Hashing is also used to verify the integrity of a file after it has been transferred from one place to another, typically in a file backup program like SyncBack. To ensure the transferred file is not corrupted, a user can compare the hash value of both files.

  - **Check** on lecture's video @2:50 how to save in console the logged object in global state!

  - see how we use ` push`` to first save the channel.id and then `set``` to save the message! [Saving Data](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/admin/save-data)
  - about firebase timestamp. Docs: "A placeholder value for auto-populating the current timestamp (time since the Unix epoch, in milliseconds) as determined by the Firebase servers."
  - Check logic: If user tries to send the message without writing anything, we save an error message in state. Then we use that to indicate to user where and what went wrong.

  - Check in `Channels.js` for the `handleNotifications` function, the following notes: Changing the value of the argument of the function, makes the function not pure...
    Moreover notifications comes from state and we modify it and we set it back to state.
    Is this good practice?
  - [Retrieving Data](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/admin/retrieve-data)
    Value:

    The value event is used to read a static snapshot of the contents at a given database path, as they existed at the time of the read event. It is triggered once with the initial data and again every time the data changes. The event callback is passed a snapshot containing all data at that location, including child data. In the code example above, value returned all of the blog posts in your app. Everytime a new blog post is added, the callback function will return all of the posts.

    Child Added:

    The child_added event is typically used when retrieving a list of items from the database. Unlike value which returns the entire contents of the location, child_added is triggered once for each existing child and then again every time a new child is added to the specified path. The event callback is passed a snapshot containing the new child's data. For ordering purposes, it is also passed a second argument containing the key of the previous child.

  - The `findIndex()` method returns the index of the first element in the array that satisfies the provided testing function. Otherwise, it returns -1, indicating that no element passed the test.

  - About snap.numChildern() and more... check: [firebase. database. DataSnapshot](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/js/firebase.database.DataSnapshot#numchildren)

- [Updating data](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/web/read-and-write)

- 47 Check in `MetaPanel.js` an onClick function `setActiveIndex = (event, titleProps) => { ... }` that gets data (`tittleProps`) from the dom element, whithout us setting any. When we log them we get that: `onClick: Æ’ (event, titleProps)`...

- 49

  - in `Messages.js` and `countUserPosts` check for: [in operator ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/in)
  - in `MetaPanel.js` and `displayTopPosters` (@6:30) check for: [Object.entries()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/entries)
  - Interesting use of `reduce` with an object in acc.

- Messages.js

  ```js
  countUserPosts = messages => {
    let userPosts = messages.reduce((acc, message) => {
      // console.log('messages',messages);
      // console.log('message',message);

      if (message.user.name in acc) {
        acc[message.user.name].count += 1;
      } else {
        acc[message.user.name] = {
          avatar: message.user.avatar,
          count: 1
        };
      }
      return acc;
    }, {});
    this.props.setUserPosts(userPosts);
  };
  ```

  - Check also in Messages.js use of `reduce` with an array in acc.

  ```js
  countUniqueUsers = messages => {
    const uniqueUsers = messages.reduce((acc, message) => {
      // With this if check we get from every comment the user's name
      // just once...
      if (!acc.includes(message.user.name)) {
        acc.push(message.user.name);
      }
      return acc;
    }, []);
    const plural = uniqueUsers.length > 1 || uniqueUsers.length === 0;
    const numUniqueUsers = `${uniqueUsers.length} user${plural ? "s" : ""}`;
    this.setState({ numUniqueUsers });
  };
  ```

  - Another interesting function in `MetaPanel.js`:

  ```js
  diplayTopPosters = userPosts =>
    Object.entries(userPosts)// b[1] = b of the index of 1 ...
    // The array has two arrays, and the first has one element with the name of the user.
    // The second has two elements the avatar and the the count of messages.
    // So b[1].count ...
    // [key, val]: The key seams to be the first array... the name of the user.
    // The syntax of the `map` function is

  let new_array = arr.map(function callback( currentValue[, index[, array]]) {
    // return element for new_array
  }[, thisArg])

      // There is nowhere a `key` argument. But in `Object.entries()` we read that:
      // "The Object.entries() method returns an array of a given object's own
      // enumerable string-keyed property [key, value] pairs..."
      // So when we do [key, value] we destructure the currentValue from the map function.

      .sort((a, b) => b[1].count - a[1].count)
      .map(([key, val], i) => (
        <List.Item key={i}>
          <Image avatar circular src={val.avatar} />
          <List.Content>
            <List.Header as="a">{key}</List.Header>
            <List.Description>{this.formatCount(val.count)}</List.Description>
          </List.Content>
        </List.Item>
      ))
      .slice(0, 5);
  ```

  - @5:24 Why in `ColorPanel.js` - `saveColors` we use `push` while in the same case in `Messages.js` - `favoriteTheChannel` we don't?

```js
saveColors = (primary, secondary) => {
  this.state.usersRef
    .child(`${this.state.user.uid}/colors`)
    .push()
    .update({ primary, secondary })
    .then(() => {
      console.log("Colors added");
      this.closeModal();
    })
    .catch(err => console.error(err));
};

usersRef.child(`${currentUser.uid}/starred`).update({
  [currentChannel.id]: {
    name: currentChannel.name,
    details: currentChannel.details,
    createdBy: {
      name: currentChannel.createdBy.name,
      avatar: currentChannel.createdBy.avatar
    }
  }
});
```

From the [docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/admin/save-data):

...the Firebase clients provide a push() function that generates a unique key for each new child. By using unique child keys, several clients can add children to the same location at the same time without worrying about write conflicts.

```js
var postsRef = ref.child("posts");

var newPostRef = postsRef.push();

newPostRef.set({
  author: "gracehop",
  title: "Announcing COBOL, a New Programming Language"
});

// we can also chain the two calls together
postsRef.push().set({ author: "alanisawesome", title: "The Turing Machine" });
```

...

In JavaScript, Python and Go, the pattern of calling push() and then immediately calling set() is so common that the Firebase SDK lets you combine them by passing the data to be set directly to push() as follows:

// This is equivalent to the calls to push().set(...) above

```js
postsRef.push({
  author: "gracehop",
  title: "Announcing COBOL, a New Programming Language"
});
```

  - About [FileReader](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader) Object:
    The FileReader object lets web applications asynchronously read the contents of files (or raw data buffers) stored on the user's computer, using File or Blob objects to specify the file or data to read.

  - About [FileReader.readAsDataURL()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader/readAsDataURL)
    The readAsDataURL method is used to read the contents of the specified Blob or File. When the read operation is finished, the readyState becomes DONE, and the loadend is triggered. At that time, the **result** attribute contains the data as a data: URL representing the file's data as a base64 encoded string.
    Also: [File and FileReader](https://javascript.info/file).

  - [react-avatar-editor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-avatar-editor)

    ```js
    // If you want the image resized to the canvas size (also an HTMLCanvasElement)
    const canvasScaled = this.editor.getImageScaledToCanvas();
    ```

    - [URL.createObjectURL()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL/createObjectURL)

    - [HTMLCanvasElement.toBlob()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLCanvasElement/toBlob) The HTMLCanvasElement.toBlob() method creates a Blob object representing the image contained in the canvas; this file may be cached on the disk or stored in memory at the discretion of the user agent.
